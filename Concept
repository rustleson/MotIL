Experience System
-----------------
    * Levels
        + each stat has 50 total levels
        + expLev(1) = 0, expLev(N) = e^((N - 1) / 4) - 1) * Lk
        + Lk = 100 by default, lesser is for talented, bigger is for untalented
    * Variable stats
        + pain
	    - decrease with time
	    - higher sensitivity, slower decrement rate
	    - increase when you take wider/longer thing than your slot's max radius/depth
	    - higher sensitivity, faster increment rate
            - higher level of pain, slower pleasure is increasing, very high levels can even decrease pleasure
            - when you reach max pain level, you are dying (is it permanemt?)
        + pleasure
	    - decrease with time
	    - higher sensitivity, slower decrement rate
	    - increase when you take friction in your slot
	    - higher sensitivity, faster increment rate
            - higher level of pleasure, slower pain is increasing, near orgasmic pleasure levels can even decrease pain
            - when you reach max pleasure level, you are taking orgasm and experience
        + experience pool
            - increase when experience is taken
            - reallocating to different experience dependent stats on specific actions
            - stop increasing when you reach max experience value (50L exp value)
    * Experience dependent stats
	+ total level
        + Slot stats
            - max potential slot diameter depends on level*wideRatio
            - max potential slot length depends on level
            - max current slot diameter sD(xp) = min(curLevN, (ln(xp / Lk) + 1) * 4 + 1) * maxD(50) / 50
            - max current slot length is same formula as diameter
        + Pain max level
            - get experience from pool when you taking pain
            - higher pain, more experience reallocate
        + Pleasure max level
            - get experience from pool when you taking pleasure
            - higher pleasure, more experience reallocate
	+ 8 artifacts levels
            - get experience from pool when you are using corresponding artifact
    * Level dependent stats:
        + each new level you have N points to spend between stats
	+ sensitivity (complection)
	+ pain resistance
	+ arousal boost
	+ speed (single impulse value)
    * Sources of experience:
        + increasing pleasure level (minor experience -> reallocate pool -> pleasure max level)
        + increasing pain level (minor experience -> reallocate pool -> pain max level)
	+ reaching orgasm (exponential to diameter)
	+ dying from pain (probably permanent death instead)
	+ taking seed from creature (exponential to creatures' level + increase elemental stat)
	+ using artifact (reallocate pool -> elemental level exp)
