Build Instructions
------------------

Game is developing using Flex 4 SDK, so following steps are required 
to successfully compile the application from a source:

1. Download and install Flex SDK from 
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html

2. Put mxmlc on your system path.

3. Change directory to MotIL/

4. Launch following command:
mxmlc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -output build/MotIL.swf -source-path=src src/Main.as

Compiled Flash application will be at build/MotIL.swf

You can also write you own custom script for automatic build. For
Unix users, see MotIL/build.sh as a working example.
